# 404 → 302

A simple gesture for an evergreen Web.

```# nginx
location / {
error_page 404 =302 https://2017.4042302.org$request_uri;
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}```

**What if links never died?** What if we never broke the Web? What if it didn’t involve any extra work?

It’s possible. And _easy_.

Just make your 404s into 302s.
